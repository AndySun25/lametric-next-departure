# Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the data collection and usage practices of the "Next Departures (Andy's fork)" application.

## Information Collection

The "Next Departures (Andy's fork)" application does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). The application is designed to fetch and display publicly available renewable energy data from the [SL Transport Departures](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/our-apis/sl/transport/#/default/Departures).

## Data Sharing

Your personal information will not be shared with any third parties unless required by law or necessary to fulfill a service you have requested.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- The right to access any personal information we hold about you
- The right to request correction of any inaccuracies in your personal information
- The right to request deletion of your personal information
- The right to object to the processing of your personal information

Since this application does not collect personal information, these rights primarily apply to any communications you have with us outside of the application itself.

## Security

While we take reasonable measures to protect the anonymous usage data we collect, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
